Contents of Project
--------------------
This project contains three parts:
-Arduino Due framing library
-Arduino framing library
-Python Framing modules


Usage of Project
-----------------
This project is designed to be used to provide a protocol for communication
between and Arduino (or Arduino DUE) and python. The included source files
provide the necessary objects that can be used in your projects to send
data packets with flag bytes, data stuffing, and CRC 16 error checking.

For further details on usage of either the Arduino libraries or python 
modules see README files inside subfolders.
